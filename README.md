Employee attrition prediction model
mployee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning


The goal of this project is to build, train and test a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using features such as employee job satisfaction, distance from work, compensation and performance. This project could be effectively applied in any Human Resources department to predict which employees are more likely to quit based on their features.
   

I have been tasked with writing an Academic paper in IEEE format using the A4 template found here:  https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. The paper should be 8 pages in length including references and documented evidence of a practical element you have carried out. I am required to submit this paper to a relevant conference or journal as directed by my supervisor.
IEEE referencing formats is required as per the paper template. Please use the appropriate referencing format for the paper template indicated in the relevant conference.
